# beautiful_buttons

This project now features support to accessibility.

Currently only font-size features are implemented but is easy to implement many more.

The accessibility directive can be used with the "appAccessibility" attribute. This makes it possible to globally ajust font scale across the application.

It is possible to implement other changes over other elements if needed (font-family, color (for color blind), etc).

The font scale can be ajusted by the (+) more (-) less buttons on the header, or using the options menu. These features can be added or removed in the "options-popover.ts" file.
